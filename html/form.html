        Thank you for taking an interest in joining LC!

        Please take a moment to fill out this form, to provide us some basic information to gauge interest alongside basic details.

        If you've been accepted as a member, we will try to contact you as quickly as we can.

        <p>
        Disclaimers
        No, we aren't asking you to sign your life away. Far from it.

        Any time put towards LC is to be assumed to be volunteer time for the time being. Lightning Creations is still growing, and we haven't finished a major project yet, nor do we currently have a source of income. If the option comes for us to be able to pay you for what you've done, we'll get back to you then.

        Any contributions made to closed-source LC projects are owned by LC. This is mainly just to save us the legal nightmare that would arise from a Member working on an LC project and then leaving; we'd like to keep using your contributions and not have to rewrite it from scratch; we do enough of that already ðŸ™ƒ. If you would like to be able to copy your own code outside of LC, just let us know; we'll almost certainly okay it.

        There will be a license for open source contributions as well, but that has not been written yet.
